=head1 NAME

runurl - Download a URL and run as a program, passing in arguments

=head1 SYNOPSYS

runurl [I<OPTS>] I<URL> [I<ARGS>]...

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<-?> B<--help>

Debug mode

=item B<-d> B<--debug>

Debug mode

=back

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=over 8

=item B<URL>

The URL of the progran to download and run

=item B<ARGS>

Options and arguments for the downloaded program

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The B<runurl> command is a simple tool that downloads a program (or
script) from the specified URL and runs it.

The first argument to the B<runurl> command is the URL of a script or
program that should be run.  Any leading "http://" may be omitted, but
"https://" or "ftp://" and the like must still be specified.

All remaining arguments listed after the URL (including ones which
look like options) are passed verbatim to the program as its own
options and arguments when it is run.

The exit code of B<runurl> is the exit code of the program, unless the
original download of the URL failed, in which case that error is
returned.

=head1 EXAMPLES

If the following content is stored at http://run.alestic.com/demo/hello

  #!/bin/bash
  echo "hello, $1"

then this command:

  runurl run.alestic.com/demo/hello world

will itself output:

  hello, world

=head1 CAVEATS

Only run content that you control or completely trust.

Just because you like the content of a URL when you look at it in your
browser does not mean that it will still look like that when B<runurl>
goes to run it.  It could change at any point to something that is
broken or even malicious unless it is under your control.

Realize that you are depending on the network for commands to succeed.
If the content is temporarily unavailable or has been moved, then the
B<runurl> command will fail.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This program requires that the following already be installed:

  wget
